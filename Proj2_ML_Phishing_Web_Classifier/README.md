# Phishing Website Detection Based on Machine Learning Methods

We use “Type” as y-value for further modeling.
0 - benign, 1 - malicious

Seven models are designed for the research to be trained and fitted to predict the type of given websites. 

The seven models are random forest classifier, logistic regression, linear SVC, K-Neighbor classifier, Gradient boosting, Decision tree classifier, and Ada-boosting.
